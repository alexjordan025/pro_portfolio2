                <p class="text-left">
                    I am a 25 year old aspiring full-stack web developer living in Atlanta, GA. My attention to detail, ability to adapt and take advice will all help me on my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer in the next stage of my life. Which, in turn, will assist me at building and maintaining websites.</br>
                    My love for IT started as a child playing PC and console games alike. However, 'Runescape' and LoL quickly became my every day ritual after school. I started my education in business administration, but eventually switched my major to criminal justice, the more I became interested in cyber security. From my enrollment
                    at GSU all the way through my graduation, I worked in IT in my school's computer lab/helpdesk where I learned valuable troubleshooting and problem solving skills. This is where my attention to detail began to blossom</br>
                    I will receive my certificate in full-stack web development from a coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech in August 2022 and would like to explore and enhance my abilities developed in coding. At that point I will be ready to start a new journey/career in the industry.</br>
                    My hobbies include: basketball, football, video games, and spending time with friends both irl and virtually.
